However, the range of use cases and applications in this document is much broader, which requires much more flexibility in how each TS implements and operates its ledger. Each service may enforce its own policy for authorizing entities to register their claims on the TS. Some TS may also enforce access control policies to limit who can audit the full ledger, or keep some information on the ledger encrypted. Nevertheless, it is critical to provide global interoperability for all TS instances as the composition and configuration of involved supply chain entities and their system components is ever changing and always in flux.\r\n```",
